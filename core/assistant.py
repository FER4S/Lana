        Gate: an EMAIL_KEYWORDS hit, OR live conversation email context (a
        just-announced/just-listed batch, or an in-flight criteria search).
        Natural follow-ups carry no email keyword ("yes, please", "the last
        one about the invoice", "maybe three weeks ago"), so once emails have
        been surfaced OR a "find this email" search is awaiting more detail,
        every remaining turn is classified — unrelated turns fall through via
        not_email at the cost of one fast Haiku call. Without the
        pending_search check, an answer to Lana's own re-ask ("roughly two
        weeks ago") would carry no keyword and no last_listed/announced batch
        either, and would wrongly fall through to plain Claude instead of
        continuing the search. Classification runs before the "no accounts
        connected" check, so a keyword false-positive ("read me a poem") with
        zero accounts still correctly falls through to Claude. A classifier
        failure/timeout always resolves to "not_email" (see EmailManager.
